# **(HS-219) - Professional Ethics**

(For Engineers)

Objectives: The main objective of this course is to apprise potential engineers about social factors that contribute towards enhancing their professional performance for the good of society and the country. This course is culture specific and has to be taught within the context of local and national socio- economic environment. The engineers are expected to supervise several people in different capacities and their understanding about human behaviour is critical for their optimum performance. Modification of human behaviour or getting work done from sub-ordinates and seniors remain a major challenge for all the professional engineers. This course will enhance understanding about the determinants of human behaviour, which ultimately will result in improved individual efficiency.
